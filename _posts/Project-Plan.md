# Power Generated of a Wind Turbine

In 1919, A German physicist Albert Betz concluded that no wind turbine could transform more than 16/27 (59.3%) of the kinetic energy of the wind into mechanical energy turning a rotor. Till date, his postulate is being referred to as the Betz Limit or Betz’ Law.  Regardless of the inefficiencies in the generator, but in the very nature of wind turbines themselves.

The theoretical maximum power efficiency of any design of wind turbine is 0.59 (a wind turbine can generate i.e. no more than 59% of the energy carried by the wind). Once we also factor in the engineering requirements of a wind turbine – strength and durability in particular – the real world limit is well below the Betz Limit with values of 0.35-0.45 common even in the best-designed wind turbines. 0.30-0.35 could be the better considering the wear and tear of the wind turbines over time.

## Deriving the empirical formula

> 1) The power output of a wind generator is proportional to the area swept by the rotor – i.e., double the swept area and the power output will also double.
> 2) The power output of a wind generator is proportional to the cube of the wind speed – i.e. double the wind speed and the power output will increase by a factor of eight (2 x 2 x 2)!

Wind is made up of moving air molecules which have mass – though not a lot. Any moving object with mass carries kinetic energy in an amount which is given by the equation:
